I have created a my profile as a website. It contains information about me, so many things that people do not know about me. I have tried to incorporate as many tags and features as I could. I learnt many new things from this task.
I would like to thank my mentor-Vedang, and the entire team of MIST for giving me this opportunity to learn something new and also helping me whenever I felt lost.
